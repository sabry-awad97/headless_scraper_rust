Soft straight hair,"I really liked the mask and it is really easy to use. It did actually leave my hair looking amazing but I actually got out the shower and had a rash all over my arms which I've never had before, ever. I can't be sure it was the mask but it was the only new thing I had used. It went down with an antihistamine and I think I would try the mask again to be sure it wasn't that and because my hair did actually look great but maybe just a warning if you are super sensitive as I'm not and I think it affected me.

It‚Äôs a yes from me üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Love this new hair mask! The texture is rich and creamy and easy to apply. I have super curly and coarse hair and I find it difficult to track down a hair mask that‚Äôs buttery and balmy without weighing down my curls. This smoothed out my strands and reduced frizz while still giving my curls bounce and shine.  Not sure if Im meant to use it through my roots too but my hair was in need of some love so I did and I felt it softened my hair and didn‚Äôt create any build up or irritation on my scalp.  Also anyone who has curly hair knows the struggle with knots ü•¥ I used a wide tooth comb while the mask was processing and it created a really good slip for detangling.  Really loved the scent too - it‚Äôs light and yummy but not too much. Im a fan. Another goodie from Tidal Hair üòçüòçüòç,7 months ago, Mel Jade Gladding

Tidal Hair Mask,"What I love the most about this hair mask is that it helps detangle my hair! My hair can get really knotty and this makes it so easy to brush. I also love that after using the treatment my hair always feels so smooth, light and soft ‚ò∫Ô∏è",7 months ago, Faith M. 
5 stars! ,"I am super low maintenance with my hair and this was an easy addition that made such a big difference. My hair feels so soft, is smoother than usual and has less flyaways, not to mention it also smells like I‚Äôve just stepped out of the salon - but in the comfort of my own home ü§ç.

SO hydrating ,Been using this hair mask once-twice a week for the last month and I am truely loving it!! It not only smells so luxurious but the results are amazing. Leaves my hair so moisturised and soft. Definitely worth giving it a try. ,8 months ago, Savannah  
Smooth hair ,First of all I adore the tube it comes in and the bright orange packaging is really pretty. I think the whole packaging is really thought out and looks so stylish in the bathroom. The mask itself is a beautiful silky smooth texture and when applied to my hair it instantly feels softer and conditioned. I apply it after shampooing and my purple toner. When I rinse it out after 10 minutes my hair is super soft and manageable.  I feel like I do t need to condition my hair after the mask as it‚Äôs perfect already. I just dry off my hair and style as usual and you can definitely notice a difference. My hair is very dry due to blonde upkeep and it‚Äôs noticeably softer and smoother even after one use. I have less fly ways and my hair feels so good. ,8 months ago, Leanne Le s. 
I‚Äôm in love!!,"The best hair mask ever! It made my hair feel super smooth and healthy. I had just dyed my hair and desperately needed something to give it some more moisture and softness, it completely tamed my hair and made it incredibly soft üòçüòç I‚Äôm so obsessed!",8 months ago, Sofia 
Obsessed,"Absolutely love the feeling of my hair and manageability after this mask! The smell is really sweet & floral but still pretty subtle, and the texture I found was still lightweight that it didn‚Äôt feel heavy and leave any residue like some hair masks can. Feels so silky after being rinsed,  makes styling hair easier, and if I want to leave my hair natural my curls have no frizz. Absolutely love üíï ",8 months ago, Greyci A.

Beyond impressed! ,"After using this hair mask, I was totally impressed with the quality and results after one use. As a hair dresser, I‚Äôve been through so many different hair masks and this one has really stood out by far! Any many years of chemical treatments on my hair, it has left it super damaged and dry but this mask completely changed the texture of hair. My hair now feels so soft and strong! I also love how it is free of parabens and sulfates so it‚Äôs perfect for anyone who colours their hair or has keratin  treatments <3 , Before & after pics below! ",8 months ago, Tasmyn B.
