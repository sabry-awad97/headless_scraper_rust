Mask review,Makes hair smoother and silky,6 months ago, Ellen J. 
Soft straight hair,"I really liked the mask and it is really easy to use. It did actually leave my hair looking amazing but I actually got out the shower and had a rash all over my arms which I've never had before, ever. I can't be sure it was the mask but it was the only new thing I had used. It went down with an antihistamine and I think I would try the mask again to be sure it wasn't that and because my hair did actually look great but maybe just a warning if you are super sensitive as I'm not and I think it affected me.

Soft & Shiny hair ,"Love this product , made my hair feel soft and shiny and the ends of my hair so much smoother .",7 months ago, Cayla 
It‚Äôs a yes from me üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Love this new hair mask! The texture is rich and creamy and easy to apply. I have super curly and coarse hair and I find it difficult to track down a hair mask that‚Äôs buttery and balmy without weighing down my curls. This smoothed out my strands and reduced frizz while still giving my curls bounce and shine.  Not sure if Im meant to use it through my roots too but my hair was in need of some love so I did and I felt it softened my hair and didn‚Äôt create any build up or irritation on my scalp.  Also anyone who has curly hair knows the struggle with knots ü•¥ I used a wide tooth comb while the mask was processing and it created a really good slip for detangling.  Really loved the scent too - it‚Äôs light and yummy but not too much. Im a fan. Another goodie from Tidal Hair üòçüòçüòç,7 months ago, Mel Jade Gladding
